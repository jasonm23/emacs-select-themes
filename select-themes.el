;;; Commentary:

;; select-themes.el provides interactive theme selection using the default
;; completing-read interface, differs from M-x `load-theme' by
;; disabling other loaded themes first.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defun select-themes (theme)
  "Interactively select a THEME, from the available custom themes.

You can also select '*Emacs default*' to return to Emacs default theme.

Note: multiple enabled themes cause Emacs to slow down, so we
disable them before selecting the new theme."
  (interactive (list (completing-read "Select theme: "
                                (sort (custom-available-themes) 'string<)
                                nil nil nil nil
                                "*Emacs default*")))
  (mapc 'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
  (unless (string= "*Emacs default*" theme)
    (load-theme (intern-soft theme))))

(provide 'select-themes)
;;; select-themes.el ends here
